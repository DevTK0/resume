# My resume

Hi! I'm Terence, a full stack developer and this is my resume built in React with tailwind css.

Access the site here:

You can also download the PDF version of the site here:

# Generate the PDF

This project uses puppeteer to generate the PDF from the website. To generate the PDF, simple run the generate-pdf.js script in the pdf folder or alternatively, run the script in the package.json

`npm run pdf`
